These are the MarkLogic XQuery and ancillary files that used to run
the Norman.Walsh.name weblog when it was a MarkLogic application.

They're not really designed for public consumption. There are weird,
hard-coded defaults and all sorts of bad practices herein. Use at your
own risk. YMMV.

The last commit is 2013, a decade ago. I've moved the weblog onto
different systems. I was only reminded of this repository because
of a CVE warning about jQuery.

I'm going to remove jQuery entirely and archive this project.
